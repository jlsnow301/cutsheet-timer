## Installation Instructions:

1. Download and extract the project files to a folder on your computer.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

3. Run the setup script:

   - On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ./setup.sh

   - On Windows:
     setup.bat

4. You can now run the script by dragging a PDF file onto it or using the command:
   python main.py path_to_your_pdf_file.pdf

Note: The setup process may take some time, especially on Unix systems where Python is compiled from source. Make sure to set up your Google Maps API key in a .env file before running the script.
